This information seems new. CBS has an article out FBI Probe

“CBS News has learned that U.S. investigators are looking into whether Trump campaign representatives had a role in helping Russian intelligence as it carried out cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and other political targets in March 2016.

This new information suggests that the FBI is going back further than originally reported to determine the extent of possible coordination. Sources say investigators are probing whether an individual or individuals connected to the campaign intentionally or unwittingly helped the Russians breach Democratic Party targets.”

So the first thing that seems new is that the FBI is going further back in time, and the next bit of news, “helped the Russians breach Democratic Party targets.” So they are looking at potential help in the hacking or maybe a mole in the DNC, which does come up in the dossier written by Christopher Steele.

The next bit of news is this:

“Now, one year after the Russian operation began, sources say the FBI’s investigation is nowhere near over. It involves dozens of agents in Washington, New York and London. The NSA and CIA are also gathering intelligence from inside Russia.”

So we are working directly with London and inside of Russia. This is a huge ass investigation. This gives us insight. They would not assign this much manpower to an investigation if they didn’t have some solid leads. And we’ve all heard the rumors that foreign Intel has offered help. Now we have London as one source.

Also in the story, the number of paid operatives, 15,000. Holy shit, that’s huge. And...they’re trying to figure out who paid them. Sources also say that money may have been the motivator for all of this but they want to get the investigation right before coming forward. This is actually a bombshell of an article put out today.
