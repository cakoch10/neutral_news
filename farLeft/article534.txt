farmers, don't let your hops grow up to be Slurm

Hi again beer fans, happy Friday!

h/t the full pint — Short’s Brewing, of Elk Rapids MI, has come up with a couple of the strangest names I’ve ever seen for their new beers.

Short’s Brewing Company announces the addition of the Salvacious Planemo Sour Series and Slurm to their 2017 Release Schedule.

No thanks, I’ll pass on the Slurm. Salvacious is a good word but wtf is a Planemo?

And on the subject of beer naming, are there any other Jeopardy fans here? Were you watching a couple weeks ago for the beer Final Jeopardy?

Answer: This beer that debuted in 1897 was named after the twentieth century.

Anybody know it? Don’t cheat. I didn’t get it, only one of the contestants did and it made him champion. If nobody knows I’ll put it up later.
