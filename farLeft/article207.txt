A daily series, Connect! Unite! Act! seeks to create face-to-face networks in each congressional district. Groups regularly socialize but also get out the vote, support candidates and engage in other local political actions that help our progressive movement grow and exert influence on the powers-that-be. Visit us at Daily Kos every morning at 7:30 A.M. Pacific Time to see how you can get involved. The comment thread is fun and light-hearted, but we're serious about moving the progressive political agenda forward.

Have you ever decided to move far away because of a failed relationship?

Sometimes in life it is game over quicker than you expected. Domestic quarreling between partners can go on for so long that it seems no other existence is possible, and then suddenly someone shows you the door and says, in effect, “game over.”

My neighbor was just shown the door. Her response is to move hundreds of miles away to another city ASAP. Well, actually, she wasn’t “shown the door.” Her partner just left through the door and has permanently abandoned their domicile. Being abandoned or thrown out are two different things, except for maybe emotionally. It is very complicated, and way above my pay grade to understand.

It is sad because their dogs always got along really well...the owners could not though.

So just a few days after her partner moved out and ended the three-year relationship, my neighbor made the dramatic decision to move hundreds of miles away from all friends, family, and job prospects. She always had the vague dream of one day living by the beaches of sunny SoCal, and now she’s going to do it.

I don’t get it. When you are depressed, or brought low by circumstances, isn’t it better to have some kind of social safety network close by?
