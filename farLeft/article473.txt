I agree with Senator Bernie Sanders on some things but this:

"Some people think that the people who voted for Trump are racists and sexists and homophobes and deplorable folks. I don't agree, because I've been there. Let me tell you something else some of you might not agree with, it wasn't that Donald Trump won the election, it was that the Democratic Party lost the election," Sanders said while speaking at an Our Revolution rally in Boston with fellow Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).

The latter statement is debatable, to be sure, I was no big fan of Secretary Clinton even though I voted for her in the general election.

But that initial statement...

Well, shit, Bernie, it ain’t like you’re the only one that’s “there”...wherever the fuck “there” happens to be

Voters for The Occupant certainly voted for a racist, sexist, homophobic, lyin’ ass pussy-grabbing traitorous Ku Klux Klan-endorsed degenerate of a man to become President of the United States.

As someone (Brainwrap?) said, if The Occupant’s voters are not racist, sexist, homophobic, and whatnot then those attributes certainly were not a deal-breaker for them.

I know that some people now regret their vote for The Occupant (although not very many).

I could probably “work” with them.

But whitewashing one of the primary reasons that people voted for The Occupant?

If the Democratic Party chooses to go in a direction where this type of excuse making and whitewashing is acceptable, I will no longer be a Democrat.

Well, technically, I do call myself an independent...but the bottom line is...I’m not co-signing this type of bullshit from someone who’s supposed to be the head of “outreach” for the Democratic Party.

After all, this type of “outreach” is obviously not meant for me and my eyes and ears and it seems as if Sanders and his supporters are taking my vote for granted just as surely as some of his supporters accused other Democrats of doing.

That’s all I got!
