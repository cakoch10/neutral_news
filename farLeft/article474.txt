The scandal now becomes pretty clear. Trump was tanking financially. No legitimate banks would loan to him. His lifeline was partnering with Manafort and Kushner to launder the money of Russian oligarchs by way of New York real estate. Of course Putin knew all this, and has had Trump under his thumb. Putin decides to make him president. For Putin, undermining American democracy has been much more valuable than satisfying the oligarchs. It was almost childâ€™s play in the context of the free-for-all of the American media and social network environment. Bernie bots really were bots. Jill Stein. Destroying Hillary. Undoing the Republican primary candidates.

The FBI was onto all this before the election but couldn't act because they would never have been able to prove it or bring the case before the election. In other words, exposing it before the election stood a very good chance of backfiring. The charges would have become part of chaos. Trump might have won anyway and then what? So they are taking him and his cronies down now. They include Pence and many other Republicans in the coverup. Maybe even Ryan. As the cliche goes: We are in uncharted territory.
