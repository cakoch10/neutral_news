Just caught a tweet from ProPublica that the White House is releasing the financial disclosures for 180 staffers.

x Tonight, the White House is releasing financial disclosures for 180 staffers. But theyÃ¢ÂÂre making it very hard to get them. — ProPublica (@ProPublica) March 31, 2017

ProPublica, the NY Times and others are saving this into a google docs folder and asking for help to sift through them for items of interest. In addition, the NYT is live-blogging their findings.

Personally, I doubt that these boiler-plate forms will reveal anything really interesting, but if reviewing data dumps is your thing, happy hunting!

Here’s the link to the form to share if you find anything worth looking into further:
