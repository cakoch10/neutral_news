Call it a boycott or call it a strike, but the U.S. women’s national ice hockey team won’t play in the world championships starting in Michigan on Friday—and now, according to reports, they will get serious support from the men in their sport:

If USA Hockey is unable to come to terms with the current team members and instead uses replacement players, it would “trigger” a boycott of the men’s world championships, a person with knowledge of the talks amongst NHL players who is not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY Sports.

Since the women are taking action for fair pay and against gender discrimination by USA Hockey, this would be a particularly powerful statement coming from the men who are reaping the benefits of the problematic system.

USA Hockey appears to be putting a lot more work into finding replacement players than into coming to terms with the current team members, though:

USA Hockey has gone from women’s hockey well to women’s hockey well looking for replacements for the U.S. women’s team. The latest attempts have apparently come to Under-16 teams — yes, they’ve reached out to kids — to play against professional hockey players in just a few days time. However, the solidarity across women hockey players has been staunch. The NWHL, one of two professional women’s hockey leagues in North America, said they stand by the players. In an incredible showing of support, professional and amateur hockey players alike have stood together against USA Hockey.

Solidarity is a beautiful thing. USA Hockey had better get the message.
