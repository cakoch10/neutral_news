Just a friendly reminder that some stuff that is too good to be true will be posted everywhere and anywhere “today,” so watch out what you share to avoid looking like a fool.

Of course, given the nature of politics right now, it might be tough to tell the difference between the absurd real and the plausible fake...

Good luck out there!
