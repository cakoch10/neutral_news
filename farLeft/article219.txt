On behalf of Fox 5 Atlanta, the independent pollster Opinion Savvy gives Democrat Jon Ossoff two good pieces of news in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. The poll shows Ossoff easily advancing past the April 18 top two primary, but more importantly, Ossoff is competitive against each Republican they tested him against June 20; in fact, Ossoff posts small leads in three of the four matchups.

We’ll take a look first at the April primary, which pits all the candidates on one ballot:

Investigative documentary maker Jon Ossoff (D): 40 Ex-Secretary of State Karen Handel (R): 20 Businessman Bob Gray (R): 10 State Sen. Judson Hill (R): 10 Ex-state Sen. Dan Moody (R): 8

None of the other 13 (!) candidates take more than 2 percent of the vote. Now, here is how Ossoff performs against four different Republicans in hypothetical June matchups:

42-41 vs. Ex-Secretary of State Karen Handel 44-42 vs. businessman Bob Gray 44-45 vs. state Sen. Judson Hill 46-44 vs. ex-state Sen. Dan Moody

This is the first poll of the June general election we’ve seen. The survey does have one pessimistic note for Team Blue, though: While Trump won this traditionally suburban Atlanta seat just 48-47, the poll gives him a 53-46 approval rating, which indicates that the undecideds like him. However, the GOP is taking this race seriously, and Paul Ryan’s allied super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, just dropped an additional $1.1 million in ads on Ossoff, taking their total investment here to $2.2 million.

We have a chance to deal Donald Trump and Paul Ryan a shocking loss. Please chip in $3 today to help Jon Ossoff fight back.
