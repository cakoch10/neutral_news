Hi folks, I hope everyone is enjoying this wonderful early spring weather.

We’re trying something new with an early start time to give folks an opportunity to attend and still have a free afternoon.

I’m looking forward to seeing old friends and being inspired.

The mountains are in full bloom and the Dogwoods are just getting started. The weather is cool and clear today with highs in the 60’s and lows in the 40’s. Have a great weekend!
