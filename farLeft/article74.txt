I hate April Fool’s Day — actually I’ve hated St. Patrick’s Day more but here on DKos, the number of dumbass predictably dumbass diaries on April 1 are annoying since there actually may be real news which gets swallowed up by stupidity.

If you get your jollies with what is stupider than Sean Spicer defending the Sexual Pervert in real life — go for it. Thankfully it is on a Saturday this year.

I think I’ll stick with BBC Radio, The Guardian and ProPublica and other sources of info and see if the horror of our world shows up here without a weak har-de-har-har.
