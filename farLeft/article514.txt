DEAR DEMOCRATS in Office â€”

You need to fight! Resist! Obstruct! Vote no!

You need to make Trump and your Republican counterparts work hard to ruin our democracy!

You need to make those Republicans work hard to screw over the American people!

You need to make them work hard to destroy this country and this planet!

Do not compromise with Trump, McConnell, Ryan, or any of them because they lie, and any compromise you make will lead to them running you down as they run over the Constitution like a piece of worthless paper.

If you do not fight, you will show Putin that his manipulation of our elections was a success.

If you do not resist, you will show your constituents that you are weak and do not deserve the title you now have.

If you do not fight now, and we happen to actually make it to the next election without getting annihilated, then you will have shown the American people and the world that you are not strong enough to be in the office you got voted in to in the first place.
