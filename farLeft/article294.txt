Democratic North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper

When North Carolina lawmakers enacted a sham repeal Thursday of the state's anti-LGBTQ "bathroom bill" known as HB2, they locked in discrimination against gay and transgender individuals for the foreseeable future. Though the new law eliminated the requirement that restrooms used by transgender individuals be dictated by the gender assigned to them at birth, it provided no statewide nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people while simultaneously prohibiting local jurisdictions from filling that yawning gap in leadership.

While all this was business as usual for state's Republican lawmakers—who enacted the job/revenue killing law in the first place—it was a stunning turnabout for the Democrats, writes the New York Times.
