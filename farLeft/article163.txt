Georgia Democratic Jon Ossoff (at right)

Well, we knew this was coming. You don’t raise a million bucks for a congressional special election and have Republicans not take notice. But it’s safe to say we had no idea the GOP’s response would look this utterly bizarre. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC closely tied to House Speaker Paul Ryan, just announced plans to spend $1.1 million on a minute-long TV ad attacking Democrat Jon Ossoff for the sin of—and we’re not joking here—dressing up as Han Solo in college.

I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything quite like this. Maybe if Ossoff had donned a Jar-Jar Binks costume, then the GOP might have a point. But seriously, Republicans want to shell out a million bucks on this?

(You can watch the CLF’s ad—and chortle like Jabba—below.)

That’s still a lot of money, though, and Ossoff is going to need to match that. So you know what to do:

Give $3 to Jon Ossoff so that he can take down the Empire. And may the Force be with you!
