Rick Wilson

Enjoy this roughly 1-minute rant by Republican strategist Rick Wilson.

I think he sums up our grifter-in-chief Donald Trump perfectly, especially when he explains how Trump tried to sell Americans on his "flatulent mass‚Äù known as Trumpcare.

I love the smell of Republicans warring with each other in the morning.

Some of the highlights:

The thing was a hot mess from the get go, but Trump was trying to sell what Trump always sells which is sort of a flatulent mass of his own fantasy about what the product is.

At the end of the day, the voters weren't buying it.

We are not going to set ourselves on fire for a bad bill, that has bad outcomes both politically and policy wise for this guy who is a snake and who will turn and bite us on the ass in a hot second, which he did.
