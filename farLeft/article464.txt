Connecticut high schooler Sarah Harrison's entry to the Doodle 4 Google competition is titled "A Peaceful Future"

This year’s winner of Google’s nationalwide Doodle 4 Doodle contest has a very optimistic vision of her future. The national finalist is high schooler Sarah Harrison, who drew today’s Google Doodle in response to the contest’s prompt “What I see for the future.”

The 15-year-old’s submission makes me happy that the children are our future because she is a lot more optimistic than I am. The statement accompanying her entry actually … dare I say it … gives me hope?

My future is a world where we can all learn to love each other despite our religion, gender, race, ethnicity, or sexuality. I dream of a future where everyone is safe and accepted wherever they go, whoever they are.

Awww.

Google was just as touched and impressed by Harrison’s entry, according to NBC Connecticut.

William Floyd, head of external affairs for Google, said in a statement that this year’s competition was meant to get students thinking about the future they want to create for the world and the submissions were nothing short of inspiring. “Ultimately, Sarah’s doodle captured the best of everything we saw, representing values like diversity, inclusion, and respect in an inspiring and creative image,” he said. Harrison said she was thinking about the current state of the world when designing her artwork. “When I started, I was thinking of how there’s a lot of animosity toward diverse communities of people in the world right now,” Harrison said. “So I wanted to draw something that I hoped would show that we can all get along well, and that it’s possible for us to be happy with each other. I want everyone try to be more open, accepting, and respectful to people. You don’t know what they’ve been through - and they don’t know what you’ve been through - so we all deserve respect from each other.”
