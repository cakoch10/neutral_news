Ooh, scary.

It’s official: Republicans are f’ing terrified of Jon Ossoff. They’ve moved from attacking him for having dressed up as Han Solo while in a Georgetown University a cappella group to trying to link him with black bloc anarchists. (Watch the video below.) The Han Solo ad was mocking—Ossoff was just a weird, callow college kid. The new ad is from the same Republican Super PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund, but now Ossoff is supposed to be violent and threatening:

Liberal extremists will stop at nothing to push their radical agenda. Now, they’re turning their attention to Georgia, and demanding that you vote for Jon Ossoff for Congress. Jon Ossoff is one of them. Ossoff will vote with Nancy Pelosi for more spending, bigger government, and a weaker military. Don’t let them hijack our congressional seat. Stop Ossoff now.

It is truly bizarre to play these ads back to back and watch the portrayal of Ossoff shift from too goofy for Congress to too scary for Congress. When all along we’re talking about a guy who, yes, sang a cappella in college, worked as a congressional aide, then became a documentary filmmaker, having gotten a master’s degree along the way. Not too terrifying … unless you’re a Republican worried he might win an election your party had taken for granted.

But millions of dollars in attack ads can have a real effect, and that’s just what Ossoff is facing. He needs us to have his back.

Can you give $3 to help Jon Ossoff counter the barrage of Republican attack ads?
