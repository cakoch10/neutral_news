This week’s CT feature in Genre 201, The Trouble with Harry (1955) by Alfred Hitchcock, was widely panned on release, as well in the intervening decades. I had never seen or heard of it until I recently came across it and found it to be a masterwork of the surreal.

Surrealism is a cultural movement that began in the early 1920s, and is best known for its visual artworks and writings. The aim was to "resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality". — Wikipedia
