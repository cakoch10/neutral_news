I make it a point in my daily life to never make fun of someones appearance. There are a lot of people out there that have lost the genetic lottery. They have been beaten severely with the ugly stick. You may say that Chuck Todd is one of those people.

The viciousness and cruelty of our Pres*dent knows no bounds. The Pres*dent has tweeted out that Chuck Todd has sleepy eyes. This is true but it is genetic and there is nothing he can do about it. To make a joking reference to someones genetic makeup is appalling.

This is not the first or last time he will do this. He has done it so many times to women. This time he did it to a man so it may go unnoticed. This is a psychological pattern of a social deviant. When will this unmitigated nightmare of a human being stop. I will not get used to this. I will not accept this as okay. It is upsetting to all Americans that this pathetic little man is our commander in chief. He just makes our lives hell on a daily basis. RESIST!
