Good call:

Sen. Claire McCaskill said Friday she will support a filibuster of Neil Gorsuch’s nomination to fill the current vacancy on the Supreme Court — a politically risky move that could escalate the partisan warfare over judicial nominations in Washington and alienate independent voters in Missouri.

The Missouri Democrat acknowledged the potential fallout and tricky politics in a statement posted on Medium, a social media site.

“This is a really difficult decision for me. I am not comfortable with either choice,” she wrote.

“While I have come to the conclusion that I can’t support Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court — and will vote no on the procedural vote and his confirmation — I remain very worried about our polarized politics and what the future will bring, since I’m certain we will have a Senate rule change that will usher in more extreme judges in the future.”

The “rule change" McCaskill referred to is also known as the "nuclear option,” so named because of its far-reaching consequences. Republicans have said they will do away with the filibuster, through a change in Senate rules, if Democrats filibuster Gorsuch. That would allow Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed by a simple majority.
