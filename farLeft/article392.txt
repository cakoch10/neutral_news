Hello, my friends.

This is the Itzl Alert Network. (Itzl is the name of the dog in the picture.) We publish a diary here every day, just before midnight. This group is here for us to check in with each other, to let people know we are alive, and doing OK.

We welcome every member of IAN to write diaries for the group. Every member is an editor, so anyone can take a turn when they have something to say. If you would like to write a diary, let us know in a comment. This is our regular schedule: Monday: Crimson Quillfeather, alternating with ZenTrainer, Tuesday: ejoanna, Wednesday: Pam from Calif Thursday: art ah zen, Friday: FloridaSNMOM, Saturday: bigjacbigjacbigjac, Sunday: loggersbrat If you'd like to be part of the Itzl Alert Network, please leave a comment asking to join, or send us a message asking to join. We'd love to have you. The bigger our network, the less likely someone will be stranded all alone.

Not in the mood for anything very creative. The title of this diary is all I want to say about fools, since I am upset with certain family members, and telling you they are fools does not seem helpful. Don’t like name calling. They are family members who have made decisions that Tonia and I do not agree with.

On a non-fool topic, I just made two batches of my vegetable smoothie. Mine has celery, habanero peppers, carrots, kale, onions, and tomato juice. I like to add salt, Worcestershire sauce, molasses, and apple cider vinegar. I made a smaller batch for Tonia’s brother, with veggies he picked out: cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, purple kale, and onion. I gave him some diced tomatoes, as well.

Will Pam post a picture of a quilt with veggies on it?

Have a nice day.
