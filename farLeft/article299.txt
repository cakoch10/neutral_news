This is how we start to take back Congress, one district at a time!

In an excellent new in-depth look at the upcoming special election in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, CNN’s Eric Bradner credits Daily Kos with launching Democrat Jon Ossoff’s campaign:

But it was the involvement of the liberal blog Daily Kos that really catapulted Ossoff onto the national map. The blog has been the largest driver of Ossoff's eye-popping $4 million fundraising effort to date. It bested its previous fundraising record for a single candidate—$412,000 for Elizabeth Warren in 2012—in a single week. Daily Kos's pro-Ossoff fundraising efforts crossed the $1 million mark on February 28.

Hats off you, Daily Kos readers! That initial blast of donations—which astounded us—led to a big round of media coverage for Ossoff, which in turn led to even more donations, which in turn led to more exposure … you get it. It’s been a very positive feedback loop, and this community was crucial in igniting it.

But Bradner also goes deeper and extensively quotes Daily Kos political director David Nir to explain how exactly we’ve helped tap into the intense outpouring of anti-Trump energy to channel it on behalf of Ossoff:

"One thing I've experimented with is putting up blog posts asking people to contribute to Ossoff at times when people (myself included!) are really feeling angry and upset at Trump in order to give them something affirmative to do," Nir emailed. "For instance, I published this post the weekend Trump issued his travel ban. It raised almost $34,000. We then sent out an email based on that post and it raised another $118,000. We've seen similar responses in other similar situations as well."

Please give $3 today to Jon Ossoff today and help him shake the GOP to its core!
