A former top official in the CIA and Defense Department describes the Trump White House as a "runaway train," saying "criminal liability" from the 2016 presidential election could extend "all the way to the top." "The image I have in my head of the White House is a runaway train," Jeremy Bash, a former CIA and Defense Department chief of staff in the Obama administration, said in an interview with MSNBC anchor Brian Williams Thursday night, after former national security adviser Michael Flynn offered to testify in ongoing Russia probes in exchange for immunity. He added that Justice Department officials would have to weigh whether Flynn's testimony would warrant protection from prosecution.

House Republicans to Trump: Steal All You Want In the above exchange, Chaffetz offers the following defenses: 1. Trump is already rich. 2. Trump enriching himself or his family in office does not affect the average American. 3. Chaffetz doesn’t think he ran with the purpose of getting richer. 4. The voters already knew he had entanglements. The logic outlined by Chaffetz leaves no possibility for Trump to engage in corruption. What if Trump asks Congress to build a highway to make it easier for customers to access one of his hotels? What if foreign countries are giving Trump’s family preferred stock in return for favorable foreign-policy decisions? Reasons one–four supply sufficient reasons for the chairman of the House Oversight Committee to neither know nor care.

The GOP Should Regroup and Approach Democrats on Health Care At this point, it will be difficult to get any congressional Democrats to cooperate on health care. They sense, correctly, that Republicans may not be able to agree on a workable plan, so the most likely scenario at this point is a continuation of the ACA status quo, with perhaps minor changes. That calculus will only change if the GOP gets its act together and comes forward with a revised and more viable plan. Such a plan need not be endorsed by all Republicans, or even passed in the House or Senate. It just needs to be a credible starting point that would make it clear to Democrats that the GOP has a plan that might actually pass and would work. To produce such a plan, Republicans need to adjust their thinking. To begin with, the party should accept as a premise that everyone in the United States should be enrolled in health insurance that pays for major medical expenses. A plan that results in an increase of 15, 20, or 25 million uninsured Americans is not acceptable and would result in a political backlash. The goal should be to produce a plan that covers even more people than the ACA, within a framework of a functioning market that relies less on federal control than the ACA. To get there, the AHCA will need to be changed in many different ways, including the following:

Some pretty good suggestions follow.

The Transparency Bills That Would Gut the EPA Two proposed laws would sever the agency from scientific experts, and scientific expertise—all under the guise of honesty and openness “They’re trying to put a positive spin on it, and for obvious reasons: You’re not going to put on a piece of paper that you’re not interested in pursuing sound science,” says Gina McCarthy, the outgoing EPA administrator. “They’re really designed to prevent us from getting the information we need to protect public health.” It’s not clear whether the bills are meant to disempower the EPA, but it is notable that they represent a politically safe way of doing so. The agency not only protects the environment; it also protects people from the environment by enforcing longstanding laws like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. And such protections are popular with Americans on both sides of the political spectrum. “It would be unpopular to attack these laws directly, but you can go after the way the EPA administers those laws,” says Yogin Kothari from the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “The result of each bill will be the same—worse science at EPA and less public health protections for American citizens,” says Eddie Bernice Johnson, ranking Democrat member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. “If these bills become law, the ultimate result will be more sick Americans and more dead Americans.”

Six Ways to Tell If Trump Is Sabotaging Obamacare The president appears to be rooting for the Affordable Care Act to fail. Here’s a guide to determine whether he’s laying the groundwork. Democrats and most health-care experts agree with the Congressional Budget Office and S&P that the ACA is mostly stable—and as The New York Time’s Margot Sanger-Katz recently put it, “Obamacare is not on the verge of ‘explosion.’” Yet as The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent wrote Tuesday, some Republicans—beyond Trump—are worried about the optics of helping the ACA succeed. Concerned that any good governance would be a “concession that the law can be made to work if Republican officials want to participate in making that happen,” they are considering actions that would actually undermine the narrative that “the law is not inherently or inevitably destined to implode.” Here are six non-legislative markers to watch to judge whether Trump is doing everything in his power to ensure that what Paul Ryan recently called the “the law of the land” will work as well as possible, or whether he chooses the cynical and even vindictive path of putting the health care of millions at risk to sabotage the ACA.

The Costs of Southern Gun Culture It's difficult to do a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of American gun culture. It fuels a multibillion-dollar industry employing around 142,000, and it kills more than 30,000 and injures an additional 70,000 annually. A new study by researchers at Stanford University tries to come to grips with one of the less frequently mentioned costs of gun culture -- the hospitalization expenses resulting from firearm injuries. The study tracked a total of 267,265 patients who were admitted to a hospital for firearm-related injuries from 2006 through 2014. Costs for initial inpatient hospitalization were about $730 million annually, or a total of $6.6 billion in constant 2014 dollars. Much of that expense landed on the public in the form of Medicaid, Medicare or unreimbursed expenses that the health-care system disperses among consumers. Yet even that is only a partial accounting.

Rich Lowry/Politico:

The Crisis of Trumpism If things continue to go badly, it’s easy to see Trump turning to the New York Democrats in his White House. This would entail less emphasis on trade and immigration and fights with the mainstream media, and more emphasis on a nonideological economic boosterism. The loose antecedent for this scenario is Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who swept into office in California as a drain-the-swamp reformer after winning a populist crusade, and then recalibrated to accommodate the system after suffering politically damaging setbacks. The range of possible outcomes of the Trump presidency is still wide. Unexpectedly, one of them is that his most die-hard populist supporters will eventually be able to say that Trumpism, like socialism, hasn’t failed, it’s just never been tried.
