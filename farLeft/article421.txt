Lincoln led the fight against the public option. She's led the fight against regulating greenhouse gasses. She's led the fight against unions. She calls groups like the League of Conservation Voters "extremists".

There's no reason for Lincoln to be in our party. She's a sure loser in November anyway, having alienated virtually everyone in her state.

The national party may stick with her out of misguided loyalty, but Bill Halter aims to rescue the Democrats from themselves, and we can help offset the big corporate backing Lincoln is getting.

Let's get to 1,800 total contributors by the end of the day! Heck, let's make it 1,850!
