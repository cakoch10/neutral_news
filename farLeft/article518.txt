● The New Jersey Education Association is done with state Senate President Stephen Sweeney and wants him gone:

The newspaper reported Monday that the New Jersey Education Association is weighing many options to oust Sweeney, a south Jersey Democrat whom the union is criticizing as someone who has frequently collaborated with Christie, a Republican, over the last seven years. "We're looking for a new governor and a new Senate president," NJEA president Wendell Steinhauer told the Inquirer. The union has even launched a website called Change NJ Politics that says by "working with Chris Christie, Sen. Sweeney betrayed our trust and broke his promises."

Sweeney doesn’t look vulnerable, but Christie is awfully unpopular—and the fact that Sweeney worked so closely with him now looks like craven cooperation with a bully because said bully was popular right at that moment.
