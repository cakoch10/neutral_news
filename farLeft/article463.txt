PETITION BACKGROUND

Trump's family business trips and vacations cost taxpayers over $11 million in just his first month in office. That $11 million paid for security on Trump's children's business trips on behalf of the Trump business organization and for Trump's three trips to the Mar-a-Lago resort, which he owns. By contrast, the Obamas' personal travel expenses were $12 million for one year.



In light of this exorbitant spending, Representative Earl Blumenauer introduced the No Taxpayer Revenue Used to Monetize the Presidency Act, or, the No TRUMP Act, to prohibit the use of taxpayer funds to pay for events, overnight stays, food, and other miscellaneous expenses at hotels owned or operated by a president or his or her relatives.



What's worse, while the taxpayers continue to pay millions for him to play golf, Trump recently unveiled his cruel and immoral budget plan that would cut funding to PBS, NEA, Meals on Wheels, heat assistance, and other important social services.



Essentially, we, the taxpayers, are paying exorbitant sums for the wealthy Trumps to further enrich themselves personally.



It's hypocrisy and it's unfair to taxpayers. Lawmakers must find a way to limit extravagant spending by this administration—especially when it profits the president personally—and prevent similar behavior by future administrations and presidents.
