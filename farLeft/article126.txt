Schuyler VanValkenburg feeling pretty good about busting past fundraising goal!

Kossacks, you read my DK diary on VA72 becoming an open seat, and you responded generously to the Democratic challenger, Schuyler VanValkenburg. This was surely key to Schuyler’s beating his fundraising goal for the quarter, and THAT means that the party will give him more help for what is now truly a flippable seat. Schuyler could really make this happen, so thank you thank you to all who chipped in!

Schuyler’s had a great month in other ways, too. He was highlighted in this DK article, which provides a rosy analysis of the data on the district, AND he was featured in this HuffPo piece.

Schuyler’s links:

Virginia has many excellent candidates running this year (the entire House of Delegates is up for election). You can find their names and links to their websites and donations pages on the 90 for 90 website. Give if you can — even a few dollars would help!

It works when we work.
