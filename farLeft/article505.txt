On behalf of the blog ZPolitics, the conservative pollster Clout Research is out with its second survey of the April 18 all-party primary for Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. The numbers are below, with the results of their February poll in parenthesis:

Investigative documentary maker Jon Ossoff (D): 41 (32) Ex-Secretary of State Karen Handel (R): 16 (25) Businessman Bob Gray (R): 16 (11) State Sen. Judson Hill (R): 9 (9) Ex-state Sen. Dan Moody (R): 5 (2) Ex-state Sen. Ron Slotin (D): 3 (not tested in February) Certified public accountant David Abroms (R): 2 (not tested in February) Businessman Bruce LeVell (R): 1 (1)

In the likely event that no one takes a majority of the vote in April, the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, will advance to a June runoff. According to this poll, Jon Ossoff looks very well-positioned to reach the runoff, while Karen Handel’s stock has dropped a bit. By contrast, rich guy Bob Gray, a Trump supporter who literally attempted to drain a swamp in one of his ads, could edge out Handel for the second runoff spot.

But there’s one number Democrats will very much like.
