run away, run away ....

Justice will be done and hopefully democracy will survive one of the most insidious attacks since its founding.

The whole #TrumpRussia story is complex but not complicated in terms of seeking justice. The nation needs a special prosecutor and an independent investigation since US intelligence agencies are constrained by a variety of practices when gathering both domestic and international evidence.

Some people will go to jail, others will leave government, yet we will get to the next election with better defenses and greater wisdom. Worse off will be all those unindicted co-conspirators, because we will definitely know the difference between witting and unwitting.

Perhaps those voters with low-information will have more than alternative facts for 2018 and understand how criminal elements may have nearly achieved the hostile political takeover of the US.

Ultimately it is clear simply from public reporting, that Trump has ties to the Russian mob, and the new/old protocols of domestic and international agencies, brought closer together by 9/11 have made justice more Byzantine. For example the FBI was more invested in the long-run traditional pursuit of the Russian mob than in an orange media clown, who in public statements, revealed he knew about the foreign electronic interventions while campaigning.

Unfortunately, social media and hacking were new, additional variables beyond the usual transfers of money laundering an FBI tended to prioritize, especially in terms of co-mingling electoral politics, money-laundering, and even hacktivism.

Making that investigation more complex and perhaps ultimately more successful are the inter-agency boundaries crossed by trying to track the misuse of an entire US political party’s campaign apparatus by a foreign power accustomed to trolling as well as micro-targeting of propaganda in social media. Much of this is now getting pieced together both officially and not.

It is not an unwitting relationship nor is it a novelty, it is a feature, not a bug(sic) of global crony capitalism and kleptocracy, and the US’s normal climate of disorganized crime became simply more organized specifically because of the Trump campaign. More insane are his claims of not knowing how mobbed-up he may have been.

The most pathetic element of it was the tacit participation of the mass of reactionary fans of a TV celebrity who while a popular vote loser, was the beneficiary of targeted electoral college GOTV efforts and the mistakes of a Democratic party opposition.

2016 has produced a perfect stormfront for an anti-democratic cabal who are now fomenting a budding domestic race war and potential increases in regional military actions.

Unfortunately they really didn’t plan on winning the election, rather expecting to consolidate some gains on one side and further control of organized crime on the other. The GOP is apparently still figuring out whether this convergence of international crime and national politics was fortuitous.

Hence the bumbling Congressional actions by the majority party and the immediate attempts to roll back democratic policy, regulations, and laws, compelled by the desperation of Agent Orange as he tries to relive the divisive public rallies of the campaign while maintaining at minimum the integrity of his golf stroke.

What would have been easier to cover up or at least leave a new trail of bodies in Russia, has become a much more public spectacle in the US, and those indicators of the current strategy of tension become described as they have in the first day of Senate Intelligence Committee hearings. The problem will come as more stonewalling and firewalling could come as the Trump administration and its associates seek to evade impeachment and/or prosecution.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation cannot tell us what we need to know about Donald Trump’s contacts with Russia. Why? Because doing so would jeopardize a long-running, ultra-sensitive operation targeting mobsters tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin — and to Trump. But the Feds’ stonewalling risks something far more dangerous: Failing to resolve a crisis of trust in America’s president. WhoWhatWhy provides the details of a two-month investigation in this 6,500-word exposé. The FBI apparently knew, directly or indirectly, based upon available facts, that prior to Election Day, Trump and his campaign had personal and business dealings with certain individuals and entities linked to criminal elements — including reputed Russian gangsters — connected to Putin. The same facts suggest that the FBI knew or should have known enough prior to the election to justify informing the public about its ongoing investigation of potentially compromising relationships between Trump, Putin, and Russian mobsters — even if it meant losing or exposing a valued informant… In secret court proceedings that were later unsealed, both current and former government attorneys argued for extreme leniency toward the man when he was finally sentenced. An FBI agent who expressed his support for the informant later joined Trump’s private security force… The resulting picture is not a pretty one for Donald Trump. However, because of its efforts to neutralize the organization of perhaps the world’s most powerful mobster — a man considered a serious national security threat — the Bureau might just have compromised its own ability to provide to Congress or inform the American public about all of the ties that exist between Trump, his presidential campaign and the regime of Vladimir Putin… The Russian mob should also not be confused with a mere crime syndicate. It is an organization comprised of state actors, oligarchs, and specific groups of individuals working collectively with the authority of the Russian government — a “mafia state.” At times, it is difficult to tell where the mob ends and the government begins… Donald Trump, Bayrock partner Tevfik Arif, and Felix Sater attend the Trump Soho Launch Party on September 19, 2007 in New York. Photo credit: Mark Von Holden / WireImage The role of Felix Sater Although shuttering Sater’s operation was considered a great success, authorities soon decided they could leverage it to get even bigger fish. Thus, they cut a deal with Sater, seemingly to help them go after the Russian-speaking mob, and its “Brainy Don,” Semion Mogilevich. Instead of serving jail time, Sater became a highly valued FBI informant. Using unnamed connections, Sater arranged to locate some Stinger missiles that Osama bin Laden had supposedly placed on the market — an older model that could be used to shoot down commercial airliners. Immediately after September 11, 2001, Sater received a call from the chief of a new section in the FBI who wanted to talk to him about Stingers, according to Salvatore Lauria in The Scorpion and the Frog, co-authored with journalist David S. Barry. Months later, Sater joined Bayrock — the real estate development company with offices in Trump Tower — and he was soon partnering in business deals with Donald Trump himself. This raises some interesting questions: Did Sater take the job at Bayrock at the FBI’s direction? Indeed, was Sater’s business relationship with Trump at the FBI’s behest?… Sater’s tenure at Bayrock might have lasted longer, had The New York Times not “outed” his criminal past in 2007. Yet a few years later, after Sater had left Bayrock, he could still be found in Trump Tower. But now he was apparently working directly for Trump himself, with an office, business cards, phone number and email address all provided by the Trump Organization. The cards identified him as a “Senior Advisor to Donald Trump.” Today, Trump claims to have trouble remembering Sater. “Trump was asked about Sater in depositions related to other cases in 2011 and 2013. In the first, Trump acknowledged that he used to speak with Sater ‘for a period of time.’ Yet in the second, Trump said, ‘if he were sitting in a room right now, I really wouldn’t know what he looked like,’” Mother Jones reported… On March 22, the Associated Press reported that Manafort had been paid the astonishing sum of more than $10 million a year in the 2000s by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally, to implement a plan that would “greatly benefit the Putin Government.” Stranger still, just last month, Trump associates Sater and Michael D. Cohen, Trump’s personal attorney, lobbied then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn with a scheme to lift sanctions on Russia, imposed after it seized Crimea. They delivered a proposed “peace plan” for Ukraine that infuriated the country’s current prime minister. The proposal would have advanced the ambitions of a pro-Russian politician whose movement Manafort helped shape… The Trump-Sater-Mogilevich-Putin saga, with its intertwining domestic and international threads, is almost certainly a battleground for powerful elements in the US intelligence complex. Even unravelling one thread — the FBI’s “running” of Felix Sater as an informant — is a challenge at every level. The FBI historically has been riven by internal battles over priorities and strategies — and the Bureau has waged fierce turf wars with other intelligence agencies, notably the CIA.
