On March 10, 2017, Noorena Shams, a 19-year-old sportsperson from Lower Dir, addressed a youth event at the United Nations headquarters on women’s rights and education.

The Commission on the Status of Women, a UN body working for gender equality and women empowerment, organises a two-week session every year on women’s rights and is attended by representatives of UN member states, civil society organisations and UN entities. Shams was invited by Malala Fund to address this year’s session which was themed around the issue of women’s economic empowerment in the changing world of work.

Currently residing in Peshawar, Shams has been playing quite a few sports professionally. At the age of 15, she disguised herself as a boy to play cricket because there was no accessible academy for girls in the city. As a squash player, she joined the world ranking in just three years. She was also among the top 40 junior players of Asia in 2015. She has participated in several national and international sports competitions and has won 63 gold, 24 silver and five bronze medals so far. In 2008, she became the youngest South Asian to win a silver medal in Junior Olympics for cycling.

“Growing up, I felt intense energy inside me and I knew I had to channel it somewhere positive. So I started playing different sports,” she explains.
