We cannot be passive, we must continue to rise up and show Trump we cannot and will not be swept away. Our rallies and marches show just how powerful we are. We must Resist. Resist the Repeal of the Affordable Care Act, Resist The BAN of Muslims coming to this country, Resist the De-funding of Plan Parenthood, Resist the Supreme Court Nominee — Resist everything they want to tear apart… Climate change — LGBTQ rights — Science — National Parks —

We need to keep up the pressure on our Reps in Washington D.C.. RESIST!

We still support Hillary Clinton — That will not change. Yes, Hillary did not win — we know that. Losing an election, does not negate the work she has done in the past or the work she will do in the future.

"Let resistance plus persistence equal progress for our Party and our country."-Hillary

We are — Stronger Together!

#TheResistance

All are welcome!
