When campaigning for office gets tough (and believe me sometimes it does), I like to remind myself why I’m running.

I’m running because everyday 400,000 Virginians, who could be eligible for Medicaid, go without health insurance.

I’m running because everyday thousands of children struggle to learn in overcrowded classes without enough teachers and counselors.

I’m running because everyday my youngest daughter turns on the TV to see a President who demeans the very values I want her to hold dear.

I’m running for all of these reasons, but more than anything I’m running to give a voice to the voiceless and to stand up for all those who cannot stand for themselves.

I’m running to bring change to Richmond, but I need your help.

Let’s win this race together.

Best,

Elizabeth Guzman

Progressive Democratic Candidate, Virginia House of Delegates, 31st District
