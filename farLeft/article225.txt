Hello again painting fans.

This week I will be continuing with the Cold Spring, NY scene. The photo that I'm using is seen directly below. I'll be using my usual acrylic paints on a 5x7 inch canvas.

When last seen, the painting appeared as it does in the photo directly below.

Since that time I have continued to work on the painting.

Changes for this week are all on the house itself. Of note is the porch. I've elected to uncover the farthest portion, covered by the trees in the photo. The roof now extends its full length. I've also reshaped and added shadows to the details on each porch post. These now convey a clear Victorian character. Above, I've refined the overhangs. Finally, I've evened out the siding color but this will likely change again before I'm done.

The current state of the painting is seen in the photo directly below.

I'll have more progress to show you next week. See you then.
