A chastened and humbled Donald Trump slumped towards the first tee of the Chevy Chase Country Club this morning, and after two swings which completely missed their intended target, the Faux President turned to reporters from MSNBC, CNN, and said, “You guys, I am so sorry for the mean and inexcusable way I have been treating you all. Starting today, I will stop lying to you, instructing my shill Spicey to stop yelling at you, and I will admit what a total screw-up my first two months have been here in DC.”

Trump then proceeded to announce that he will be on Monday asking Congress to forgive him for committing treason against the United States by working with Vladimir Putin’s government to turn the 2016 election in his favor. Trump also told the aghast reporters standing there at the first tee that he, Donald Trump would be asking to have the name “Chump” be affixed to all buildings now named “Trump” this or that. He also noted that he hadn’t given up all his financial holdings, but that he would be the new ad-man for Weight Watchers, as soon as he gets out of prison.
