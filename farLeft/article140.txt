Secretary of State Rex Tillerson cut short his recent visit with South Korean officials due to "fatigue," the Korea Herald reported on Friday.



According to the newspaper, the top U.S. diplomat did not have lunch or dinner with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn during his visit.

The Korea Herald noted that Tillerson spent several hours meeting with Japanese officials, which included dinner meetings.

The secretary of State reportedly did hold talks with both South Korean officials regarding the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear program.

Tillerson warned in remarks Friday that the U.S. "policy of strategic patience" with North Korea is over, saying the Trump administration would not rule out military action.

"All options are on the table," Tillerson said.



South Korea will likely see a significant change to its leadership in the coming weeks after the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye in March.

The country must now hold a vote on a new leader within 60 days of the ruling.
