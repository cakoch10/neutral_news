Country Music Awards festival lineup has been announced and a new release from country royalty.

FOX’s Michelle Pollino has “FOX Country”:

The CMA Festival lineup has been released and as expected its chock full of country stars. Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert, Eric Church, Chris Stapleton and Maren Morris are all scheduled to perform at the festival’s centerpiece concerts. The move for Morris to the big stage shows just how quickly her star has risen.

The nightly lineups include Blake Shelton, Keith Urban, Sam Hunt, Florida Georgia Line and more, plus this year country vets Kenny Rogers, Trace Adkins, John Anderson and Tracy Lawrence open respective nights at Nissan Stadium. The four day fest starts June 8.

Country music’s power couple, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, aren’t just touring together this year, the couple are also giving us a new collaborative album, according to The Boot. The album’s title isn’t released yet, but March 23. Hill and McGraw will release the first single from their new album, titled “Speak to a Girl.”

The 2017 “Soul2Soul Tour” will kick off on April 7 in New Orleans, LA.
