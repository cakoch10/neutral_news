The Cadbury CrÃ¨me Egg has a new neighbor in the candy aisle â€” or should we should call it a friendly competitor?

The seasonal sweet, which has long been one of the most popular egg-shaped candies on the shelf, may have some serious holiday-time competition from a brand-new Reese's treat this Easter.

And no, we're not talking about Reese's Peanut Butter Eggs.

THE WEEK IN PICTURES

This spring, Reeseâ€™s is debuting their new Reese's Peanut Butter CrÃ¨me Egg.

A spokesperson from Reese's described it as a "three dimensional egg, filled with Reeseâ€™s signature Peanut Butter, covered in creamy milk chocolate."
