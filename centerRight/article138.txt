April is National Library Month; the perfect time to remember the importance of reading.

FOX’s Lisa Brady reports in this week’s “FOX on Family”:

It seems more likely to find a child holding a smartphone or a laptop than a book:

(Todaro) “They text with people, they may answer simple questions, like what was the ‘Movie of the Year’; did ‘Moonlight’ win or did ‘La La Land’ win?”

But Julie Todaro, the American Library Association President says when it’s time to study or to read for enjoyment:

(Todaro) “We know ‘Harry Potter’, they still go to print.”

And the earlier and more often kids are exposed to reading, even as infants, the better:

(Todaro) “Kids in emergent literacy learn critical thinking skills from hearing parents read to them.”

It can also improve attention span and help all of their other subjects in school. But what if your kid doesn’t like to read?

Todaro says librarians can help by asking the right questions:

(Todaro) “They will find books that dovetail with someone’s, not reading level, that’s less important than likes and dislikes.”

She says libraries evolve with technology and remain an important community resource.

In addition to being president of the American Library Association, Julie Todaro is Dean of Library Services at Austin Community College in Austin, Texas. They have 47,000 students and 11 campuses, soon to be 13, each with its own library. She notes the importance of access to libraries for people who might not have access to certain resources at home. One Pew study found at least 25% of households in the U.S. do not have internet or wireless access.
