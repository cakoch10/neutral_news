Donald Trump promised when he was on the campaign trail to end political correctness on college campuses. Now, students would be more than willing to ban professors from teaching if they supported Trump at any point.

In a new video from Campus Reform, correspondent Cabot Phillips goes undercover at American University and poses as an activist from a fake student group “American Students for Diversity.” While undercover, Phillips is filmed asking students on campus to sign his petition to ban Trump supporting professors from teaching on campus.
