President Trump’s daughter will soon be a government employee, advising her father.

FOX’s Jon Decker has more from the White House:

Ivanka Trump is becoming an official government employee, and will serve as an unpaid adviser to her father in the White House.

Ivanka Trump’s title will be assistant to the President. Her husband, Jared Kushner serves as a White House senior adviser.

Ivanka Trump, who already has an office in the West Wing, will be subject to all of the same rules as other federal employees, including a law prohibiting conflicts of interest.

Ethics experts complained when it emerged last week that Ivanka was to be given a security clearance, without formally joining the administration.

At the White House, Jon Decker, FOX News.
