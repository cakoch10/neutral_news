Immunity for General Michael Flynn in exchange for his testimony on Capitol Hill, may not be happening.

FOX’s Jon Decker has more from the White House:

A grant of “testimonial” immunity from the House or Senate Intel Committee could protect Mike Flynn from potential future charges from the Justice Department. But so far, no deal.

Back in September in an interview with NBC, Flynn made it clear how he felt about people who seek immunity:

(Flynn) “When you are given immunity, that means you have probably committed a crime.”

The F.B.I. is investigating the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.

The President tweeted: “Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt by media & Dems, of historic proportion!”
