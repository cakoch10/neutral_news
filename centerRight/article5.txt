Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is urging the country's Supreme Court to review its decision stripping congress of its last powers, a ruling that set off a storm of criticism from the opposition and foreign governments.

In an address early Saturday after a meeting presided over by Maduro, the National Security Council has announced that is supporting a review by the court "with the goal of maintaining institutional stability."

The announcement capped an extraordinary day in which Venezuela's chief prosecutor and long-time loyalist of the socialist government broke with the Maduro administration and denounced the court ruling. Luisa Ortega Diaz said it was her "unavoidable historical duty" as the nation's top judicial authority to decry the ruling against the opposition-controlled National Assembly as a "rupture" of the constitutional order.
