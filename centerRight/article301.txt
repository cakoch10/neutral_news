Investigators in Oklahoma say it wasn’t the first time that three who’re killed in a suspected home invasion this week, broke into the same property.

FOX’s Jeff Monosso reports:

Maxwell Cook, Jacob Redfern and Jakob Woodruff were shot to death while allegedly burglarizing a home in Broken Arrow in suburban Tulsa and police now say it was the teens’ second trip to the home after breaking into a detached garage earlier the same day to steal liquor:

(Rodriguez) “I heard them kick in the door. I heard them kick it three times, and shortly after that, that’s when I heard the gunshots.”

That’s 21-year-old Elizabeth Rodriguez, the alleged getaway driver, who police say was the mastermind behind the break-in.

She says she’s sad that her friends are dead, but she doesn’t feel responsible. She’s now jailed on burglary and charged with her friends’ murders.
