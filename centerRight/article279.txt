The Trump University settlement has been approved by a federal judge in San Diego. Thousands of students expect to get back almost all of what they spent on real estate investment classes.

FOX’s Jessica Rosenthal reports:

After the election, when the President agreed to settle, he said he would’ve won if he’d gone to trial, but he didn’t have time for a trial anymore. Thousands of students said they had been scammed by the expensive Trump University classes.

Judge Gonzalo Curiel had given preliminary approval to the $25 million settlement last year and before giving final approval, he said the deal looked fair. More than 3700 students will get back roughly 90 cents on the dollar.

Before he approved it though, he had to consider an objection from one of the settlement’s class members. She said the deal was unfair and that it didn’t give her time to opt out and preserve her right to sue the President individually, but Curiel went ahead and approved the settlement.
