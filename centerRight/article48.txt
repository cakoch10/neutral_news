FOX’s Eben Brown has your “FOX Bullet Points”:

I’m Eben Brown.

Connecticut could get a whole lot more gun friendly, if certain state legislators get their way. They’ve been discussing handgun concealed-carry permit reciprocity with states of similar standard for issuing permits. Currently Connecticut has no reciprocity, per se, but will issue permits to non-resident with permits in other states. The Norwich Bulletin newspaper reports Connecticut saw permit applications last year jump more than 70 percent.

The NRA is hoping to discredit a claim by a gun control group about the effectiveness of suppressors in preventing hearing loss. The group ‘Americans for Responsible Solutions’ tweeted out that earplugs work better than supressors. The NRA highlights a CDC study saying suppressors are superior. The NRA and suppressor manufacturers claim the devices are safety tools and buyers shouldn’t be subject to background checks, wait periods or special taxes.

And those are your Bullet Points!

I’m Eben Brown, FOX News!
