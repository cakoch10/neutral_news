In this episode of The Willie Robertson Podcast, Willie is joined by his sister-in-law Missy who has an amazing jewelry line called Laminin. Not only is the jewelry beautiful and unique, but the story behind the company is as well.

Missy joined forces with Project 41, a Christian non-profit that rescues women and children from sex trafficking, to provide women of West Monroe, Louisiana with meaningful employment.

During the podcast, Missy introduces Brandy and Lara, two women who share their heartbreaking stories and how working at Laminin gave them purpose. And be sure to check out some of Missy’s beautiful jewelry at laminindesigns.com.
