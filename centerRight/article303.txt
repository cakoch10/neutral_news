Several key Democrats are keeping their votes to themselves days before a showdown over Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch's confirmation.

Gorsuch needs 60 votes to end a filibuster backed by most Democrats, meaning the GOP needs to pick off eight members of the minority.

If Democrats block Gorsuch, Republicans promise to go "nuclear," ordering a vote to change the Senate's rules to allow his nomination to go forward on a majority vote.
