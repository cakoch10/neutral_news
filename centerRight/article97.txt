Volkswagen settles with 10 U.S. states over diesel emissions cheating.

FOX’s Jeff Monosso reports:

Volkswagen says it’s agreed to settle environmental claims with 10 U.S. states, including New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, over excess diesel emissions stemming from its rigged diesels that cheated on emissions with so-called defeat devices.

The $157 million settlement also covers some consumer claims in total, VW has now agreed to $25 billion to address federal and state regulators fines, fixes and buybacks.

This as the company says it’s also received approval from the EPA for its dealers to soon begin selling 2015 model year diesels after they’ve had emissions software updates.
