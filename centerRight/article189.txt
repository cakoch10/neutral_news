A Muslim doctor in California has announced he’s running for Lieutenant Governor and his motivation is President Trump.

FOX’s Jessica Rosenthal reports:

Doctor Asif Mahmood announced his 2018 bid for Lieutenant Governor in front of an immigration office in Los Angeles. He said as a Muslim immigrant from the blue state of California he’d be a triple threat to President Trump who he says:

(Dr. Mahmood) “Continues to attack people like me, immigrants, people of color and Muslims. I say President Trump has it all wrong, it’s time to get tough on hate.”

In audio posted by the Sacramento Bee, Mahmood went on to say that California should be the leader of the Trump resistance. He said he came to America from Pakistan to be a doctor and wanted his kids to grow up in a place that celebrates diversity.

Aside from taking on the President, he says health care and education are at the top of his agenda.
