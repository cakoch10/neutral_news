The Oracle of Omaha getting displaced as the world’s number two richest person.

FOX’s Lilian Woo reports:

The man behind the largest internet retailer in the world is now the second richest man on the planet, according to Bloomberg’s billionaires list, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, now worth $75.6 billion, leapfrogging over investor Warren Buffett with his paltry $7.9 billion.

Only one person has Bezos beat, according to the list, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his $86 billion.

Bezos also owns the Washington Post and space exploration company Blue Origin. One goal to eventually take people on space tourism trips.
