Amber Heard is fighting a $10 million legal claim against her and saying in court papers the case “shines a spotlight on the dark underbelly of Hollywood.”

Heard is being sued for an alleged conspiracy to sabotage her own movie “London Fields,” based on a Martin Amis book, by refusing to act in “provocative” scenes in the film that “had to be removed and/or rewritten to accommodate Heard’s behavior.”

The suit filed last year also alleges that she refused to attend the film’s premiere.

But according to the Hollywood Reporter, a cross-complaint filed this week by Heard claims she “insisted on specific restrictions about nudity and sex scenes in the film as a condition to agreeing to appear” and that she had a “nudity rider” in her contract.

She alleges production company Nicola Six Limited violated the rider by secretly filming “pornographic” scenes with a body double to look like Heard.

Mathew Rosengart, attorney for the film’s producers, commented, “The cross-complaint is a work of fiction” and “nothing more than a meritless smear tactic designed to distract from [Heard’s] own misconduct.”
