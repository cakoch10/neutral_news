Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Fox News' "The O'Reilly Factor" Thursday that illegal border crossings "are down 60 percent, just because of President Trump’s strong leadership."

Sessions also told host Bill O'Reilly that the administration would look at other possible actions against so-called "sanctuary cities" after he announced this week that federal funds would be cut off to locales that refuse to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents after detaining illegal immigrants.

"We’re looking at other possibilities that would be detrimental to people," Sessions said. "Under the Obama administration, they sent out grant notices that required people to assert they’re in compliance with the laws and threaten cutting off of various funds if they didn’t comply. So, we’ll continue to pursue that and go further."

However, the attorney general added, "we don’t want to take any measures. We want to see these cities comply ... I think a lot of these leaders need to hear from their constituents."
