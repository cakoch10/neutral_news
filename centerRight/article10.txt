In this episode of The Willie Robertson Podcast, Willie and Johnny D are joined by Hank Fortener, pastor of Mosaic Church in Los Angeles. Hank shares the story of his unique upbringing growing up in a family that adopted and fostered over 40 children, the reason why his dinner table “looks like a gathering at the United Nations”.

This inspires Willie to share some stories about his less than hygienic upbringing, including how his entire family used to share bathwater and how a cockroach once got stuck in his ear. Yes, those are true stories.

The guys also talk spirituality, Donald Trump, and the dramatic events surrounding the search for John Luke Robertson’s missing dog, Pippa.
