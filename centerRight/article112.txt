A mom took to Facebook, accusing the TSA of inappropriately “patting down” her teen son. The outraged Texas mom posted the video and described the incident on her page:

According to CBS NEWS, the TSA, who changed this pat down policy earlier their month, said they nothing wrong and were following the proper procedure after a laptop was discovered in the teen’s bag during the screening process.

The TSA said the boy cooperated during the screening process and all approved procedures were followed. As for the wait time, in a statement, the agency said the passengers were at the checkpoint for “approximately 45 minutes, which included the time it took to discuss screening procedures with the mother and to screen three carry-on items that required further inspection.”

Do you think the TSA went too far?
