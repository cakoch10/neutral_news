Twitter tweaking tweets to help you say more.

FOX’s Krystin Goodwin has the details:

Twitter allowing users a little more characters for their tweets! The company announcing usernames will no longer count as part of the 140 character limit in replies.

For example, if you reply to a tweet from “@”jon-doe”, the @username won’t count against the tweet limit. Instead of appearing within the tweet, the username will pop up above the tweet text, almost like tagging someone in a Facebook post, giving you “more characters to have conversations”.

While users are exited with the redsign-it only applies to responses to other users, not all tweets. And many are hopeful Twitter will lift the character limit altogether.

In a blog post, reps at the company say it will “continue to think about how to improve conversations and make Twitter easier to use.”
