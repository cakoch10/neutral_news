“I’m not persuaded. That’s not an argument that can be sustained,” Maryland District Court Judge James B. Sarsfield said during a court hearing Thursday. “The request is denied without prejudice.”

Prosecutors suggested an examination of electronic devices still under way contains evidence of the two rape defendants flashing “MS-13 gang signs.”
