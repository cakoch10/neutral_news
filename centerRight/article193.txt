President Trump was ridiculed by the alt-left, propaganda, destroy-Trump media when he said on Twitter that members of his transition team had been wiretapped by the Obama administration. But a damning video clip from just days before Trump’s tweet appears to vindicate the commander in chief. In a March 2nd MSNBC interview, former Obama administration official Evelyn Farkas pretty much admitted that there was an all-out effort to gather and leak as much “intel” on Trump as possible ahead of the transition to Trump. Farkas served in the Obama administration from 2012 through 2015 as the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia. “I was urging my former colleagues, and frankly speaking, the people on the Hill — it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people,” Farkas said. “’Get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can before President Obama leaves the administration,’ because I had a fear that, somehow, that information would disappear with the senior people who left.” An admission that went unnoticed, partly because it came prior to Trump’s tweet and largely because it was made on MSNBC. John Gibson caught up with Hudson Institute Senior Fellow Michael Doran to discuss if this vindicates President Trump. Listen below.
