Private aerospace contractor Space-X claims another ‘first’ in spaceflight by successfully using a recycled rocket to send a satellite to orbit.

FOX’s Eben Brown reports from Miami:

Thursday night’s launch from Cape Canaveral by Space-X might be otherwise unremarkable, except that the rocket itself, was a used model.

And that’s never been done before. The main booster phase of its Falcon Nine rocket had been used on another mission and successfully returned, instead of being lost to the atmosphere or the ocean. And what’s more, the rocket again has been recovered, landing gracefully on a barge at sea.

Space-X founder Elon Musk:

(Musk) “Fly and re-fly an orbit-class booster, which is the most expensive part of the rocket. This is gonna be, ultimately, a huge revolution in spaceflight.”

The rocket delivered a communications satellite to orbit to provide telecom service to parts of South America.
