FOX’s Michelle Pollino and Michael Tammero discuss their trip to South By Southwest earlier this month and talk about their experiences there. Michael hosted a panel about the FOX show “Prison Break” and plays a clip from a recent “In the FOX Light” interview with Dan Bucatinsky, who’s currently appearing in the FOX’s “24: Legacy”. The two touch on how people can get nasty online about all sorts of things. And you don’t want to miss Tammero’s new game.
