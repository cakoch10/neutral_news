In this episode of The Willie Robertson Podcast, Willie and Johnny D are joined by Willie’s good friend Marcus Luttrell, a former United States Navy SEAL who received the Navy Cross and Purple Heart for his actions in Afghanistan during Operation Red Wings.

You might recognize his name from the movie Lone Survivor, a film based on the operation and his experiences with SEAL Team 10. In the podcast Marcus tells us about his strange eating habits, why his faith is important to him, and how he was a “late bloomer”.

Marcus also gives his thoughts on gun control following the recent mass shooting in Orlando.
