NASCAR says goodbye to the west coast this weekend with Sunday’s race at the Auto Club Speedway at Fontana, CA. Two teams looking at fines and penalties after Phoenix race And Dale Earnhardt Jr. marks a major milestone in his career.

FOX’s Marghiee Teshineh with “FOX in the Fast Lane”:

Another great week, but not a win for Kyle Larson. Larson taking a third consecutive runner-up finish last week in Phoenix, but Larson sees this Sunday’s race at Fontana as a chance to finally break away from the pack:

(Larson) “I just hope we can continue to work hard, be consistent, be mistake free on pit road and on the race track. If we can just keep doing that, the wins are gonna come. I could easily have four wins right now, just gotta keep working hard.”

Larson looking for his first win at Fontana and first win of the 2017 season.

The crew chiefs for Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick have been hit with suspensions, fines and the loss of driver and owner points after failing post race inspections at Phoenix.

And Dale Earnhardt Jr. will be making his 600th career start this weekend.
