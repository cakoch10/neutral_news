Illegal immigrants skipping deportation hearings surged in the second term of President Obama's administration, pushing the 20-year average to 46,000 a year, according to a new analysis.

The figures indicate that 43 percent failed to appear at scheduled hearings in 2015, up from the 20-year average of 37 percent during which 918,098 were no-shows.
