Roush Performance has unleashed its latest P-51 Warbird-inspired Ford Mustang, and it sounds like it can it fly.

The silver and olive green coupe is a performance pack-equipped Mustang GT Premium with a Stage 3 Phase 2 Roushcharger supercharger fitted to its 5.0-liter V8 that, along with other upgrades, is good for a Hellcat-beating 727 hp.

Roush beefs up the six-speed manual transmission with updated rotors and friction pads, and also offers the P-51 with a six-speed automatic. Handling modifications include a three-stage height-adjustable coilover suspension, carbon fiber splitter and spoiler, and 19-inch forged alloy Weld wheels wrapped in aggressive Continental ExtremeContact Sport tires.

Retro brown leather upholstery on the seats and doors is added to the Mustang’s already aeronautical-looking cabin (the speedometer is marked Ground Speed, after all), along with a commemorative plaque, Jack Roush’s autograph on the dash and a red shifter knob that hat tips the mixture control knob in the original P-51.

The price is $42,500 on top of the donor car, so figure about $85,000 out the hangar door. Only 51 examples will be built for 2017, so it’s a rare bird.
