Fox News' Sean Hannity on Friday came to the defense of the House intelligence chairman who has come under fire for saying he read reports that President Trump and his team were under surveillance.

Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is facing criticism for going to Trump after a secret intelligence briefing before reporting his findings to his committee.

Nunes, who was a member of the presidential transition team, has resisted calls to step aside from his committee's investigation into contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians.

Hannity said the media is attempting to ignore the facts and are distracting the country by going after Nunes.

The "Hannity" host said Nunes' “bombshell announcement” could become “the biggest scandal in decades."

Nunes was on "Hannity" last week and he said “additional American names were unmasked and he saw the reports and he said they had nothing to do with Russia and collusion.”

Hannity reiterated that the “Trump White House had nothing to do with this [the outing of this information]” and said the leftist media were “doing a disservice, once again to you, the American people, by attacking Congressman Devin Nunes instead of reporting on what the scandal is.”
