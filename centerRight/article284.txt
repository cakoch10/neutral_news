NASCAR returns to the East Coast for short track racing at Martinsville Speedway for this Sunday’s running of the STP 500, Atlanta puts the brakes on their track renovation and Virginia race fans get a new place on the web to keep on all things racing.

FOX’s Marghiee Teshineh with “FOX in the Fast Lane”:

Kyle Larson heads to Martinsville’s short track this week a very happy man:

(Larson) “Lots of fun to be Kyle Larson right now. Our race cars are really fast in Xfinity and Cup, so it’s a blast to show up at the race track every week.”

And even more proud is team owner Chip Ganassi, who says you can see Larson getting better from week to week:

(Gnassi) “I think he’s starting to mature in the series and learning what the cars will accept and what the cars wont accept.”

Larson picking up his first Cup win of the season at Fontana is looking for back to back to wins this weekend.

After listening to drivers and fans officials at Atlanta Motor Speedway announced they are delay their repaving of the track until 2018.

And in a joint effort with Richmond International Raceway and over two dozen short tracks and drag strips, a new website dubbed “Racing Virginia” goes live next month offering race fans the track information all in one place.
