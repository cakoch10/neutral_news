FOX’s Michelle Pollino and Michael Tammero discuss how the media, particularly left-wing media such as “The View” are just out of control on trying to shut down opposing viewpoints. Michael plays a clip of his interview with Alec Baldwin dealing with the subject of sibling rivalries. Sarah Silverman has a new political comedy show debuting on Hulu. Page Six had a story about how Senator Chuck Schumer had his own meltdown at an upper east side restaurant when he confronted the wife of a prominent Democrat who voted for Trump. Birthday celebrant Michael quite candidly discusses “getting some work done” on his appearance as he hit 46.
