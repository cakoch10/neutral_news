Evan Rachel Wood had many reasons to relocate from Los Angeles to Nashville, but one stood out among the rest: her son.

“LA is wonderful, and it has given me so many amazing things, but I’ve also got a lot of demons here. I was ready to break it up a little bit,” the “Westworld” actress explained in the May issue of ELLE Canada.

“I wanted to give my kid some grass to run around on. Again, he’s got two actor parents. I was like, ‘You don’t need to live in LA full-time. Let’s go somewhere a little ‘normal’ for a bit.'"

Wood, who shares her 3-year-old son with ex-husband Jamie Bell, grew up in North Carolina. When the interviewer noted the traditional nature of the South, Wood said, “That’s how I was raised too. But it’s not all like that. I am in a more progressive city.”

The 29-year-old continued, “But there’s a part of me that also believes in going where you’re needed. And if I can be there, bringing something else to the table or engaging the conversation or speaking up when I need to speak up, then that’s also important. I don’t want to run scared.”

Following November’s presidential election, the relatively private Wood revealed she had been raped twice. In her new interview with ELLE, she addressed the stigma out there surrounding the idea of feminism.

“Some think that feminism is all about hating men, and they hate you for that. I love men. I have a son — I actually want a world where we can all be equal and I’m not held back because of my gender,” she said. “It’s not a movement against men! It sucks that the word ‘feminism’ is so tainted. Also, I’m in the LGBT community [Wood identifies as bisexual], and you’re told a lot that you’re going to hell and you’re a terrible person. People think that it’s a movement and we’re trying to destroy society. It’s intense.”

Wood confirmed her engagement to bandmate Zach Villa in late January.
