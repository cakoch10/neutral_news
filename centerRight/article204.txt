Nothing will stop Monica Bencomo from doing her crunches and curls. When her newborn kept interrupting her workouts, the Albuquerque, New Mexico lifestyle-and-fitness coach decided to incorporate her breast-feeding into her exercise routine.

According to an article on Cosmopolitan.com, Bencomo began experimenting with nursing while wall-sitting. She soon graduated to squats, leg-lifts, curls and more — all while feeding her baby, and documenting her impressive coordination skills on her Instagram, @momswearheels.

'MY BOOB JOB RUINED MY LIFE'

In a mere 11 months after her due date, the hot mama made the final rounds of a bikini competition — and pumped before going onstage. She still breast-feeds her now-18-month-old while exercising, though now she’s started putting her in a carrier during her workouts.

“It is rare my baby is off the boob,” Bencomo said to Cosmo. “She is usually glued to my hip, craving to breast-feed the majority of the day and night.”

There are certain moves she won’t try, however. “I can squat 250 pounds, but would never do that around my kids,” she told the site. “I just use common sense with our workouts.”
