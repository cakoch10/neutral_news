A man who was shot at least twice by a Las Vegas police officer responding to a call about an armed man at a business was in surgery at a hospital, a police official said Friday.

The officer was in the parking lot nearby, and was directed by someone from the business to find the man on the ground behind a strip mall, Capt. Kelly McMahill said.

The officer shot the man when he sat up with the gun and wouldn't put it down, McMahill said.

Neither the injured man nor the officer was immediately identified. No other injuries were reported.

The shooting, which happened about 12:45 p.m. a few miles west of downtown, was the fourth shooting involving a Las Vegas police officer in 2017 and the second this week.

Early Thursday, an officer fired once but missed an armed burglary suspect jumping a wall in a residential backyard. That man was subdued by a neighbor wielding a baseball bat.
