Another week and the Second Amendment continues to be a hot topic around the country.

FOX’s Eben Brown has your “FOX Bullet Points”:

I’m Eben Brown.

Lots of Second Amendment legislation is coming about in the past week. North Dakota gets a new law, taking effect in August, allowing so-called ‘constitutional carry’, meaning one can carry a concealed firearm with no permit or background check when purchasing.

Georgia’s senate approves a bill for campus carry on public universities. But it would not allow carrying firearms at sports events. Arkansas is considering making that provision for its campus carry allowances.

Dateline: Glenwood Springs, Colorado, where the local historical society was proud as punch to tell you an anonymous lender financed the purchase of Doc Holiday’s Derringer, the one supposedly at his side when he died in a hotel room in the tiny town west of Denver. They paid $84,000 for it. But now, experts doubt it’s the real thing, saying the man who possessed it for decades was a known huckster.

And those are your Bullet Points! I’m Eben Brown, FOX News!
