5 p.m.

Hawaii's Department of Public Safety hasn't yet been served with a lawsuit alleging that guards and a worker sexually assaulted 10 inmates at the state's women's prison.

Department spokeswoman Toni Schwartz said Friday officials won't comment until they receive the lawsuit and have had time to discuss it with lawyers.

The women's lawsuit says the employees gave them food, makeup, crystal meth and special privileges for complying with sexual demands.

One of the allegations describes a female guard coercing an inmate to have sex in a control room, a bathroom and a closet.

Another allegation describes a male guard forcing a woman to perform oral sex and then taunting her about it when her boyfriend visited.

The lawsuit says one of the plaintiffs attempted suicide.
