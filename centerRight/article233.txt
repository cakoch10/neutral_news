North Carolina’s controversial “Bathroom Bill” may be effectively overturned, now that the state’s General Assembly approves a new measure striking much of the original law aimed at preventing use of public restrooms according to gender identity. But many LGBTQ activists say the new law is not any better.

FOX’s Eben Brown reports:

North Carolina’s house bill two was crafted last year to counter a Charlotte city ordinance making it illegal to prevent a transgendered person from using a public restroom of their new gender identity.

The state law was denounced as discriminatory and big name employers and pro-sports leagues threatened to leave the state over it. But a new law, approved by the legislature and supported by the new governor would take away the ban on transgender bathroom use. But there are some in the LGBTQ community who say the new bill legalizes discrimination by preventing city’s from making their own ordinances.
