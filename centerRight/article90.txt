Rhett’s “Craving You” is one of his songs that he has been playing live during his ‘Home Team Tour’, the good news the new song will available Friday and it is the first single from Rhett’s forthcoming third studio album.

They toured together and now Cole Swindell and Dierks Bentley have teamed up for a brand-new music video: Flatliner. The two have been playing the song together on Bentley’s ‘What the Hell World Tour’ and they wanted to bring that energy to the the party anthem’s official music video.

And after 12 years, Carrie Underwood has left her longtime label switching to Capitol Records Nashville, part of Universal. Doesn’t mean much for fans, but for Underwood she will have a chance to do duets with those under that label, however what happens to her longtime CMA host partner ship Brad Paisley, who is an artist under her now former label Sony.
