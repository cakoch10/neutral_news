The President has some choice words for Republican lawmakers who opposed his health care bill.

FOX’s Jon Decker has more from the White House:

A week after the House Freedom Caucus played a prominent part in killing the Republican health care bill, the President Trump took to Twitter to write, “The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don’t get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!”

In response, Freedom Caucus co-founder Ohio Republican Jim Jordan had this message for the President:

(Jordan) “The Freedom Caucus is trying to change Washington. This bill keeps Washington the same. Plain and simple.”

President Trump’s tweet suggests he may attempt to primary some members of the Freedom Caucus next year.

At the White House, Jon Decker, FOX News.
