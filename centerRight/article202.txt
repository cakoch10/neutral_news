A government statement says Iraqi fighter jets have carried out airstrikes against the Islamic State group outside Mosul, killing more than 100 militants.

Saturday's statement says the strikes hit three ISIS targets in Baaj, a remote northwestern town near the Syrian border, and killed between 150-200 militants. It said the militants had crossed over from Syria, suggesting that ISIS still enjoys free movement across the borders.

The statement didn't say when the strikes happened and officials were not available to offer more details. It could not be immediately verified.

Airstrikes by Iraqi Air Force and U.S.-led international coalition have been vital to the months-long operation to retake Mosul from ISIS. In January, Iraqi authorities declared eastern Mosul "fully liberated." Fighting is underway to recapture the city's western side.
