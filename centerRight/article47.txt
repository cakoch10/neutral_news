Disney is looking to nab one of the biggest entertainment superstars for its live action remake of ‘The Lion King’.

FOX News’ Michelle Pollino reports:

Beyoncé may be back in the movie business. Disney has reportedly asked the singer to join the cast of a live action remake of ‘The Lion King.’ Variety reports they are looking to get the superstar to voice the character of Nala, the lioness who is the childhood friend of the main character, Simba.

The 35-year-old singer recently announced she is pregnant with twins.

This isn’t the first time the singer has worked on an animated film. In 2013, she voiced the character of Queen Tara in the film ‘Epic.’ Director Jon Favreau is rebooting the picture with Donald Glover as the voice of Simba and James Earl Jones reprising his role from the original as Simba’s father Mufasa.
