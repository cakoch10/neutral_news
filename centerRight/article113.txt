U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions meets with other federal, state and local law enforcement officials in St. Louis on how to tackle crime.

FOX’s Jeff Monosso reports:

Attorney General Sessions called Ferguson, Missouri, an emblem of the tense relationship between law enforcement and those it serves, but says the Trump administration is working hard to build bridges, but also to crack down hard on the spike in recent years across the country in violence, guns, murder, and drugs:

(Sessions) “We must act decisively to reverse this rise in violent crime and to ensure public safety.”

He says law enforcement will use every toll its got as a federal task force. Evaluates recommendations while urging federal prosecutors to step up their game. He also says that the men and women in blue have been unfairly blamed for the unacceptable deeds of a few.
