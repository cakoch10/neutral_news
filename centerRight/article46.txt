Producers of Disney’s ‘Frozen’ reveal the original ending.

FOX’s Michelle Pollino reports:

Producers of Disney’s hit ‘Frozen’ revealed that the original story had a different concept, an evil Elsa:

(Frozen) “Let it go… Let it go…”

Peter Del Vecho, one of the film’s producers tells Entertainment Weekly “the film was more in line with the Hans Christian Andersen tale, Anna and Elsa were not even sisters in the original. Elsa was a villainous snow queen, pure evil.”

And that caused a disconnect with audiences, so producers working with the writers reworked the script. A sequel to the film is in production.
