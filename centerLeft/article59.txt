- Cut a circular piece of baking parchment the size of the base of the tin.

- Cut a strip of parchment long enough to wrap round the inside wall of the tin, with some overlap, and slightly taller than the tin to allow for the cake rising.

- Grease the tin by putting a little olive oil onto a paper towel and wiping it round the inside of the tin, base and walls.

- Put the pieces of parchment into the tin, using the oil to stick them in place.
