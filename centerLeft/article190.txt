Kodak Brownies â€“ in particular the Reflex, 127, and 44A models - were the most widely used cameras in British households after the Second World War.

Kodak produced the first Brownie in 1900, modelling it on the luxurious 1888 Kodak box camera that gave the company its name. Made of inexpensive materials such as cardboard, the handheld Brownies were affordable and easy to use.

Virtually anyone could now capture, collect and organise the visual story of their lives for the first time in human history. With Brownies in hand, British families began snapping their celebrations, special moments and daily life on a regular basis.
