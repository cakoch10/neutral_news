President Donald Trump left the Oval Office on Friday without signing the executive orders that he was there to announce.

"Jobs and wealth have been stripped from our country," he said before exiting.

He continued walking as a reporter shouted questions about whether Mr Trump was directing his administration to grant immunity to fired adviser Michael Flynn.

Amid journalists' confusion, Vice-President Mike Pence picked up the orders from the table, and they were signed in another room.
