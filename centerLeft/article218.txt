During his life, William Burrell developed one of the most remarkable art collections in the world. He donated it all – over 9,000 objects – to the city of Glasgow in 1944.

The building which houses the Burrell Collection in Glasgow was granted Category A listed status in 2013. Historic Scotland, who made the award, said it reflected the building’s importance as an example of 1970s architecture.
