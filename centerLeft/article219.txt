The BBC micro:bit will be put to the test at the controls of the TARDIS in this special Live Lesson in collaboration with the team behind Doctor Who.

This lesson is aimed at 11-13 year olds, and is devised around computational thinking skills. We'll be exploring search algorithms, different types of errors and the components that go into an algorithm, with guest experts from the fields of web search and computer gaming.

Using their BBC micro:bit, students will be challenged to solve a fictional disaster scenario while coming face to face with one of the Doctorâ€™s deadliest foes.
