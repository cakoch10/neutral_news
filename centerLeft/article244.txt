Gabriel Weston unlocks the secrets of the human body, meeting an engineer who fixed his own heart and a toddler whose bones were repaired before he was even born.

Gabriel Weston continues to unlock the secrets of the human body through some of the most extraordinary cases in medicine.

In this episode, Gabriel uncovers the cases of an engineer who fixed his own heart, a toddler whose bones were repaired before he was even born and a girl whose immune system attacked her own brain. We meet a man who can taste words and find out how his condition is helping develop new ways to enable blind people to navigate and even recognise colours. And we encounter a man who was immobilised by MS but can now cycle and scuba-dive thanks to a pioneering new treatment that has reversed his disease.
