Students at Georgetown University, Washington DC, have camped out overnight to see Hillary Clinton speak.

In a rare public appearance since losing last year's election, the former Democratic candidate won enthusiastic applause from her audience as she discussed women's and girls' rights.

She took shots at President Donald Trump's proposal to slash funding for diplomacy and remarked on her penchant for "talking about research, evidence and facts".
