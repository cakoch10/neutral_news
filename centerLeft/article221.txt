Protesters in North Carolina angry about the so-called "bathroom bill" are holding noisy protests outside the home of the new Democratic governor.

The state is repealing the law that requires transgender people to use bathrooms corresponding to their birth gender.

The demonstrators are opposed to the repeal deal because they say it still leaves open future opportunities for discrimination.

They say they will continue to hold their "air horn orchestra" protests, as they did under the previous Republican governor.
