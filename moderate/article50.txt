ST. LOUIS – Five months after her disappearance, police have identified human remains found in Kinloch, Missouri, as belonging to Monica Sykes, a family member told CBS affiliate KMOV.

Sykes, 25, was last seen in late October when police said she walked out of her home in Berkeley, a suburb northwest of St. Louis, and entered a white car.

In early February, the non-profit group Texas Equusearch was in the area searching for Sykes. During the search, human remains were found nearby in Kinloch.

The family member told the station they were notified Tuesday that the remains had been identified.

Sykes’ cause of death has not been released.
