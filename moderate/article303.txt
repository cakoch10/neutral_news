Over 10 million viewers tuned into 60 Minutes Sunday and saw Anderson Cooper’s interview with the polarizing French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen. She calls for stronger immigration laws, challenges NATO, and has a friendly relationship with Russia. For many of our viewers, the piece served as an introduction to the longtime politician.

To some, she sounded familiar:

Interesting segment on marine le pen on @60Minutes last night. She truly does sound like the French Donald trump. — Esteban (@etolara) March 6, 2017

@Marine2017_EN @60Minutes Love her for France as Much as I love Trump for USA PRAY FOR BOTH 🙏🏻🇫🇷🙏🏻🇺🇸❤️ — Shiela ❤️🇺🇸🙏🏻 (@WebsterShiela) March 8, 2017

I am not French and don't live in France. But if I did I would vote le pen.#TRUMP #60Minutes — Sean Ira (@SeanIra_) March 6, 2017

But it was Le Pen’s vision of France that piqued the interest of many of our viewers.

Le Pen: “France isn’t Burkinis on the beach. France is Brigitte Bardot. That’s France” #60Minutes — 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) March 6, 2017

Many viewers applauded Le Pen’s analogy.

Forget Joan of Arc. She is so saintly yesterday. On #60minutes in railing against the Burkini Marine Le Pen said "France is Brigitte Bardot" pic.twitter.com/rGKGHta1DD — franklin Brown (@franklin19788) March 6, 2017

Others thought bringing the former ingenue -- who is married to a former adviser to the National Front, Le Pen’s party -- into things set a problematic standard.

But, Le Pen says, “Foreigners in France who hold a job, who respect our laws, our codes, have absolutely nothing to worry about.” — 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) March 6, 2017

"They have nothing to fear," unless they are not like Bridget Bardot. @60Minutes #60Minutes — sylvianyc (@sylvianyc) March 6, 2017

Another viewer thought the reference to the singer and actress who was the model for Marianne, an official French symbol, for nearly a decade in the ‘60s and ‘70s was passe.

And several pointed out an inaccuracy.
