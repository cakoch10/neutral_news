Is it too early to start thinking about the films of summer 2017?

The first trailer for Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk” was released Wednesday, giving audiences their first good look at his sprawling, harrowing World War II epic that chronicles Operation Dynamo, the effort to evacuate stranded Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France.

Nolan -- the man behind “The Dark Knight,” “Inception” and “Interstellar” -- brings along familiar faces from his previous films like Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy, plus Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance and newcomer Fionn Whitehead.

One Direction member Harry Styles also makes his film debut in “Dunkirk,” and as the trailer shows, the director isn’t afraid to put the pop star in peril.

“Dunkirk” hits theaters July 21, 2017.
