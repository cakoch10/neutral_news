Davie Bowie, Barbra Streisand, Judy Garland, The Eagles, Richard Pryor, Talking Heads and N.W.A. are just a few of the artists whose work has now been marked for preservation by the Library of Congress.

On March 29, 2017, the Library named 25 audio recordings to be inducted to its National Recording Registry, a compendium of sound recordings that will be preserved as representative of America's cultural, artistic and historic treasures. Ranging from rock, pop, jazz, classical, gospel and musical theatre to radio broadcasts and comedy albums, the recordings have been recognized as vital to our nation's audio legacy.

Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden said, "This year's exciting list gives us a full range of sound experiences. These sounds of the past enrich our understanding of the nation's cultural history and our history in general."

With this year's additions, the Registry now numbers 475 historic recordings - just a small part of the Library's collection of recorded sound numbering nearly three million items.
