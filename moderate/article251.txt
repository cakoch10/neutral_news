The good news is the people behind the “Baywatch” movie aren’t taking things to seriously, at least according to the first teaser trailer for the big-screen adaptation.

While there appears to be plenty of action, more than a few explosions and lots of running in slow motion, the tone of the first look at the film -- starring Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron and Alex Daddario -- is decidedly comic, with plenty of self-referential jokes about restoring “the Baywatch brand.”

Johnson stars as head lifeguard Mitch Buchannon, who butts heads with a new recruit (Efron) brought in to boost the squad’s public image. But when a body washes up on their beach, the Baywatch crew soon find they have bigger concerns.
