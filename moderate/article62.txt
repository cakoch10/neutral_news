The first trailer for “Spider-Man: Homecoming” is out, and it looks like high school is almost as hard for Peter Parker as it is to fight villains.

Tom Holland stars in the upcoming movie as a teenage Peter Parker and the trailer shows that not only is Peter having some growing pains with a love interest, played by Zendaya (maybe Mary Jane!), but he’s also getting some tough love from his mentor, Tony Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.). To top things off, he has to go face to face with Michael Keaton’s formidable Vulture.

See the full trailer below.
