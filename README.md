# neutral_news
This is a hackathon project completed at HackPrinceton. You can find the devpost [here](https://devpost.com/software/justnews). Basically, you can input a URL to a news article and our webapp will return a list of articles on the same topic from a range of political sources.

To run the webapp clone the repo and type ```python app.py```. Make sure you're using python 2.7 and have installed newspaper (the original version for python 2.7) along with the other necessary dependencies. 

You can try a live version at [35.202.206.128](http://35.202.206.128/).
